# Pomodoro-App

This Pomodoro app is a simple productivity tool developed using Python and Tkinter. It helps you manage your work sessions effectively by following the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals with short breaks in between.

The app features customizable work durations, allowing you to set the desired length of your work sessions. After each work session, the app automatically triggers short breaks to provide you with an opportunity to rest and recharge. Every few work sessions, a longer break is scheduled to help you maintain productivity throughout the day.

The user-friendly interface displays a countdown timer, indicating the remaining time for the current session. The timer dynamically switches between work sessions and breaks, notifying you of the current phase. Completed work sessions are tracked visually with check marks, providing a sense of accomplishment and progress.

Boost your productivity and stay focused with this easy-to-use Pomodoro app! Whether you're studying, working on projects, or simply want to manage your time more efficiently, this app can help you enhance your productivity and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
